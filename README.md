### Resident Evil Wiki
A fan wiki for Resident Evil games and history. It's an SPA that, when you start scrolling, you will begin immersing yourself in the Resident Evil universe, starting from the first game and progressing through all canon games enumerated in the saga. You can view the epilogue of every game and the list of characters. You can select a character from the list to see their summary and role in the game. Each game is accompanied by relevant images. It is also mobile responsive. The technologies used were: TypeScript, Next, React, TailwindCSS and Gsap.

Will be updated sporadically with more Resident Evil games and more features.
